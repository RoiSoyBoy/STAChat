# New_Chat_Bot

## üöÄ Project Description

New_Chat_Bot is a modern, business-agnostic chatbot platform designed for seamless integration and ease of use. Built with a robust stack including Next.js 14 (App Router), TypeScript, Firebase, and OpenAI, this platform empowers businesses to create intelligent conversational experiences. It supports automatic extraction of Q&A pairs from various data sources and utilizes Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) to provide contextually relevant answers. The system includes an admin dashboard for easy management of training data and settings.

## ‚ú® Key Features

-   **OpenAI & Pinecone Integration**: Leverages OpenAI for powerful language understanding and generation, and can be integrated with Pinecone for efficient vector search (though current implementation details might vary, the architecture supports it).
-   **Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG)**: The chat API answers questions based on extracted Q&A pairs from your uploaded data. If no answer is found, the bot transparently informs the user.
-   **Firebase Integration**: Utilizes Firebase for authentication, Firestore for data storage, and potentially Firebase Hosting for deployment.
-   **Admin Dashboard**: A user-friendly interface (`apps/frontend/src/app/admin/`) for uploading URLs/files, managing application settings, and viewing training data.
-   **Automated Q&A Extraction**: Automatically extracts Q&A pairs from business websites or uploaded files using generic, language-aware patterns.
-   **Extensible & Privacy-Focused**: Designed with no hardcoded business-specific logic, ensuring no backend secrets are exposed to the frontend, and making it easy to add new Q&A patterns.
-   **Monorepo Architecture**: Managed with npm workspaces, separating concerns into frontend (`apps/frontend`), backend (`apps/backend`), and shared packages (`packages/shared`) for better scalability and maintainability.

## üõ†Ô∏è Technologies Used

-   **Frontend**: Next.js 14 (App Router), TypeScript, Tailwind CSS
-   **Backend**: Node.js with Express.js (implied by `server.ts` and middleware structure), TypeScript
-   **Database & Storage**: Firebase (Firestore, Firebase Storage for uploads)
-   **AI & Embeddings**: OpenAI API
-   **Vector Search**: Architecture supports integration with vector databases like Pinecone.
-   **Testing**: Jest, Cypress
-   **Package Management**: npm (with workspaces)

## üì¶ Installation and Setup

### Prerequisites

-   Node.js (version recommended by Next.js and other dependencies, e.g., LTS)
-   npm (v7 or later for workspace support) or yarn
-   Firebase account and project setup.
-   OpenAI API key.

### Steps

1.  **Clone the repository:**
    ```bash
    git clone https://your-repository-url/NewChatBot.git
    cd NewChatBot
    ```

2.  **Install dependencies:**
    This project uses npm workspaces. Dependencies for all packages (frontend, backend, shared) will be installed from the root directory.

    Using npm:
    ```bash
    npm install
    ```
    Using yarn:
    ```bash
    yarn install
    ```

3.  **Set up environment variables:**
    Each application (`apps/backend` and `apps/frontend`) requires its own environment configuration.

    -   **Backend (`apps/backend/.env`):**
        Create a `.env` file in the `apps/backend` directory and add necessary variables (e.g., Firebase service account details, OpenAI API key, database URLs, port).
        Example:
        ```env
        OPENAI_API_KEY=your_openai_api_key
        FIREBASE_PROJECT_ID=your_firebase_project_id
        # Add other necessary backend environment variables
        ```

    -   **Frontend (`apps/frontend/.env.local`):**
        Create a `.env.local` file in the `apps/frontend` directory and add Firebase client configuration and backend API URL.
        Example:
        ```env
        NEXT_PUBLIC_FIREBASE_API_KEY=your_firebase_api_key
        NEXT_PUBLIC_FIREBASE_AUTH_DOMAIN=your_firebase_auth_domain
        NEXT_PUBLIC_FIREBASE_PROJECT_ID=your_firebase_project_id
        # Add other necessary frontend environment variables
        NEXT_PUBLIC_API_BASE_URL=http://localhost:8080/api/v1 # Or your backend port
        ```
        *(Note: The backend port might be different, adjust `NEXT_PUBLIC_API_BASE_URL` accordingly based on your `apps/backend/.env` configuration.)*

4.  **Firebase Setup:**
    -   Ensure your Firebase project has Firestore, Firebase Authentication, and Firebase Storage enabled.
    -   Set up Firestore security rules (example in `firebase.json` or to be created).
    -   Download your Firebase Admin SDK service account key (JSON file) and configure it securely for the backend (e.g., via an environment variable or a secure path).

## üöÄ Usage

### Development Mode

1.  **Start the Backend Server:**
    From the root directory:
    ```bash
    npm run dev:backend
    # or
    yarn dev:backend
    ```
    The backend server will typically start on a port like `8080` (configurable in `apps/backend/.env`).

2.  **Start the Frontend Development Server:**
    From the root directory:
    ```bash
    npm run dev:frontend
    # or
    yarn dev:frontend
    ```
    The frontend Next.js app will typically start on `http://localhost:3000`.

3.  **Access the Application:**
    -   Open `http://localhost:3000` in your browser to see the frontend.
    -   Navigate to `http://localhost:3000/admin` to access the Admin Dashboard for data ingestion and management.

### Production Mode

1.  **Build the Applications:**
    From the root directory:
    ```bash
    npm run build
    # or
    yarn build
    ```
    This command should ideally build all workspaces (`frontend`, `backend`, `shared`). You might need to adjust the root `package.json` scripts if specific build commands are needed for each workspace (e.g., `npm run build -w backend && npm run build -w frontend`).

2.  **Start the Backend Server (Production):**
    After building, navigate to the backend's build output directory (e.g., `apps/backend/dist`) and run the server. The exact command depends on your backend setup.
    Example (if `apps/backend/package.json` has a `start` script):
    ```bash
    npm start -w backend
    # or
    yarn workspace backend start
    ```

3.  **Start the Frontend Server (Production):**
    Next.js applications are typically started using:
    ```bash
    npm start -w frontend
    # or
    yarn workspace frontend start
    ```
    This command runs the optimized production build of the Next.js app.

4.  **Deployment:**
    -   **Backend**: Deploy the `apps/backend` build to a Node.js hosting environment (e.g., Google Cloud Run, AWS Elastic Beanstalk, Heroku).
    -   **Frontend**: Deploy the `apps/frontend` Next.js application to a platform like Vercel (recommended for Next.js), Netlify, or Firebase Hosting.
    -   Ensure all environment variables are correctly configured in your deployment environment.

## ‚öôÔ∏è How It Works (Brief Overview)

1.  **Data Ingestion & Q&A Extraction (Backend)**: URLs or files are processed, content extracted, chunked, and used to generate Q&A pairs and embeddings.
2.  **Chat API (RAG) (Backend)**: User questions trigger a vector search for relevant context, which is then used with an LLM (OpenAI) to generate an answer.
3.  **Admin Dashboard (Frontend)**: Allows users to manage data sources, settings, and view training data.

---

## üß™ Testing

-   **Unit/Integration Tests (Jest)**:
    Run with `npm test` or `yarn test` from the root. Target specific workspaces with `npm test -w <workspace-name>`.
-   **End-to-End Tests (Cypress)**:
    Run with `npm run cypress:open` or `npm run cypress:run`.
