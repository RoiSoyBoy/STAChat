// import '@testing-library/jest-dom'; // Commented out to avoid potential double-import issues

// The global namespace declaration for jest.Matchers has been removed
// to avoid conflict with @types/jest and src/types/jest-extended.d.ts,
// which use a two-parameter Matchers<R, T> interface.
// The import '@testing-library/jest-dom' above ensures its types are still loaded.
